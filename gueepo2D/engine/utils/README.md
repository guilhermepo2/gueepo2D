# gueepo2D Utils

The overall philosophy of gueepo2D is that it shouldn't enforce a workflow on the one's using it, a big reason why you won't find things like editors or any sort of functionality to load resources from files (that would enforce specific file formats).

With that being said, some things on gueepo2D/utils might enforce some sort of workflow or bias towards how things should be done. I try to keep it at a minimum, or I intend to address it later.
